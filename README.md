Prophet
==========
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/SUSE/prophet.png)](https://secure.travis-ci.org/SUSE/prophet)

Loops through open pull requests on a GitHub hosted repository and runs your code
(i.e. tests) on the merged branch. After the run has finished, Prophet will
post a comment to the pull request stating whether the execution succeeded or failed.

Ever since GitHub released their awesome commit status API, Prophet also makes use
of that and sets statuses according to the execution of your code to 'pending',
'failure' or 'success'.
However, keep in mind that the account you are using to run Prophet needs to have
write access to your GitHub repository, to set statuses.


Rails projects
--------------

Installation is quite easy. If you are using bundler (i.e. for a Rails project),
just add the following to your Gemfile:

    gem 'prophet'

To configure Prophet for your Rails project, just create a new initializer:

    touch config/initializers/prophet.rb

Inside that initializer you can easily change Prophet's behavior to fit your needs.

    Prophet.setup do |config|
      # ...
      # Add custom config block.
      # ...
    end

Please read this README's configuration section for further details on
customization.

Finally, to run Prophet, just call the corresponding rake task either
manually or inside your CI (i.e. Jenkins).

    rake prophet


Other projects
--------------

Since you are able to run any command inside Prophet's execution block,
you can use it for any project and programming language. The only requirement
would be to have Ruby and RubyGems installed, such that you can run Prophet
itself.

Installing the gem manually (without bundler), is simple and straight forward, too.

    gem install prophet

Afterwards, create an executable file where you require the gem, maybe configure
it and in the end just call Prophet manually.

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby

    require 'prophet'

    Prophet.setup do |config|
      # ...
      # Add custom config block.
      # ...
    end

    Prophet.run

Please read this README's configuration section for further details on
customization.


Configuration
-------------

Even though you don't really need to configure Prophet, as it ships with some
default values for everything, there is an easy way to override all these settings
and customize Prophet to fit your needs perfectly.

Inside your configuration file - either the initializer in your Rails project or the
executable script you manually created for your non-Rails project - you can set
options like this:

    Prophet.setup do |config|

      # Setup custom logger.
      config.logger = log = Logger.new(STDOUT)
      log.level = Logger::INFO

      # Custom GitHub (GH) username/password to use for commenting on a successful run.
      # These credentials are also used for setting the status of the pull request.
      config.username_pass = 'foo-success'
      config.access_token_pass = 'bar'

      # Custom GH credentials for commenting on failing runs.
      # NOTE: If you specify two different accounts with different avatars,
      # it's a lot easier to spot failing runs at first glance.
      config.username_fail = 'foo-fail'
      config.access_token_fail = 'baz'

      # Specify when to run your code.
      # By default your code will run every time either the pull request or its
      # target (i.e. master) changes.
      config.rerun_on_source_change = true
      config.rerun_on_target_change = true

      # In order to reuse noise, you can choose to reuse & update existing comments.
      config.reuse_comments = false

      # In some cases it might also be desirable to disable the comments completely.
      config.disable_comments = false

      # Configure status context, e.g. in order to distinguish different prophets.
      config.status_context = 'prophet/unit'

      # Add custom messages for comments and statuses.
      config.comment_success = 'Well Done! Your tests are still passing.'
      config.comment_failure = 'Unfortunately your tests are failing.'
      config.status_pending = 'Tests are still running.'
      config.status_success = 'Tests are passing.'
      config.status_failure = 'Tests are failing.'
      config.status_target_url = 'http://ci.example.com/'

      # If you need to make some system calls before looping through the pull requests,
      # you specify them here. This block will only be executed once and defaults to an
      # empty block.
      config.preparation do
        # Example: Setup jenkins.
        # `rake -f /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/ci_reporter-1.7.0/stub.rake`
        # `rake ci:setup:testunit`
      end

      # Finally, specify which code to run. (Defaults to `rake`.)
      # NOTE: If you don't set config.success manually to a boolean value,Prophet
      # will try to determine it by looking at whether the last system call returned
      # 0 (= success).
      config.execution do
        log 'Running tests ...'
        `rake test:all`
        config.success = ($? == 0)
        log "Tests are #{config.success ? 'passing' : 'failing'}."
      end

    end

Prophet runs `git gc` after every run to clean up potential remains and start
the garbage collector. If you are making heavy use of Prophet, think about
running something like `git gc --aggressive --prune=now` every now and then.


Locally Testing Prophet with Docker
------

1. Copy `options.yml.example` to `options.yml` and fill it with the correct values.
2. Build the `prophet` container:
    ```
    docker build -t prophet .
    ```
2. Run the `prophet` container:
    ```
    docker run --rm -it --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/options.yml,target=/prophet/options.yml -v $SSH_AUTH_SOCK:/ssh-agent --env SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/ssh-agent prophet
    ```
